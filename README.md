# overlayprjct
My stream overlays for https://youtube.com/c/CalamarCat

## Running
`node index.js`

`http://localhost:3000/` has an index page that lists all the screens and banners availabe - navigate from there

## Downloading screens
`html2canvas` (https://html2canvas.hertzen.com) is used to allow for screens to be easily downloaded. The relevant script inclusion and setup code *should* exist in each HTML file. Hopefully commented out. Just uncomment to download.

## Todos
- ***Clean up all the CSS!***
- Convert to React or something for re-useable components and practice
- Convert to a CSS framework to make the math easier
